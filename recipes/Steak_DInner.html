    <p><strong>4</strong> servings /<strong>15</strong> mins (PREP TIME) /<strong>20</strong> mins (COOK TIME) /<strong>512</strong> (CAL/SERV)</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 bone-in rib-eye steak</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp canola oil</li>
        <li>1 half cup of red wine</li> 
        <li>2 Tbsp butter</li>
        <li>1 (6 oz) package mixed mushrooms</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>4 cups packed baby spinach</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <p>Preheat a cast-iron pan to high.<br>
           (Open a few windows and crank your oven vent to highâ€”things are about to get smoky).<br>
           Liberally season both sides of the steak with salt and pepper.<br>
           When the pan begins to smoke, add 1 Tbsp of the canola oil and swirl.<br>
           Add the steak and sear, flipping every minute, for a total of 6 minutes for medium rare.<br>
           Transfer the steak to a plate</p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
        <p> Remove the pan from the heat, add the wine to the pan, and using a wooden spoon, stir the wine, scraping up the browned bits clinging to the pan.<br> 
            Add the butter, stir until melted, and season lightly with salt and pepper.<br>
             Pour into a small serving dish and set aside.</p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p>Return the pan to medium-high heat.<br>
           Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, adding a little more oil if the shrooms are too dry, until well browned, 5 to 7 minutes.<br>
           Spoon the mushrooms over the steak.</p>
        <li>Step 4</li>
        <p>Remove the pan from the heat and add the remaining oil, the garlic, and spinach.<br>
           Cook, stirring constantly, until just wilted, about 1 minute.<br>
           Serve alongside the steak, with the sauce on the side.</p>
